feat(hardware): integrate virtual multimeter simulator

Add VisaSimulator integration to enable testing without physical hardware.
The simulator supports all 16 channels with realistic measurements and is
fully compatible with existing AsyncScanManager. It is auto-selected on
startup and appears as the first option in device dropdown.

- Add simulator mode handling in connect/disconnect workflows
- Update scan managers to accept generic device interface
- Fix RuntimeError during thread cleanup with try-except guard
- Update documentation with simulator capability notes
